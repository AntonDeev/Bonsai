**ðŸŒ² Bonsai** makes any view controller to present in a user defined frame with custom transition animation.

**Bonsai** does not change the source code of the view controller. So it can be used on view controllers on which source code is not open. For eample, UIImagePickerController, AVPlayerViewController, MFMailComposeViewController, MFMessageComposeViewController etc.

## Features

1. Makes view controller appear as
    - Popup alert
    - Notification alert 
    - Side menu
2. Transition animation 
    - Slide In from left, right, top and bottom
    - Bubble pop from an initial frame or a view
3. Supports both Storyboard and Code 
4. Blur effect on background view
5. Supports both landscape and portrait 


## How to use

```Swift
import BonsaiController
```

Add (copy paste) `BonsaiControllerDelegate` extension to your view controller

```Swift
extension YourViewController: BonsaiControllerDelegate {
    
    // return the frame of your Bonsai View Controller
    func frameOfPresentedView(in containerViewFrame: CGRect) -> CGRect {
        
        return CGRect(origin: CGPoint(x: 0, y: containerViewFrame.height / 4), size: CGSize(width: containerViewFrame.width, height: containerViewFrame.height / (4/3)))
    }
    
    // return a Bonsai Controller with SlideIn or Bubble transition animator
    func presentationController(forPresented presented: UIViewController, presenting: UIViewController?, source: UIViewController) -> UIPresentationController? {
    
        // Slide animation from .left, .right, .top, .bottom
        return BonsaiController(fromDirection: .bottom, presentedViewController: presented, delegate: self)
        
        // or Bubble animation initiated from a view
        //return BonsaiController(fromView: yourOriginView, presentedViewController: presented, delegate: self)
        
        // or Bubble animation initiated from a frame
        //return BonsaiController(fromOrigin: yourOriginFrame, presentedViewController: presented, delegate: self)
    }
}
```

## How to present the view controller 

### From Code:

```Swift
let smallVC = YourViewController() // instantiateViewController(withIdentifier:)

smallVC.transitioningDelegate = self
smallVC.modalPresentationStyle = .custom

present(smallVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

### From Storyboard:

```Swift
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {

    if segue.destination is YourViewController {
        segue.destination.transitioningDelegate = self
        segue.destination.modalPresentationStyle = .custom
    }
}
```

## Installation with CocoaPods

## Customization

###  Auto dismiss after delay

```Swift
let bonsaiController = BonsaiController(...
bonsaiController.perform(#selector(bonsaiController.dismiss), with: nil, afterDelay: 2)
```

### Disable dismiss on tap outside

```Swift
bonsaiController.springWithDamping = 0.5
bonsaiController.duration = 0.5
bonsaiController.isDisabledTapOutside = true
bonsaiController.isDisabledDismissAnimation = true
public var dismissDirection: Direction? // Availabel only for slide in transition animation
public var isDisabledTapOutside: Bool = false
```



### Custom transition animation

Implement these two method for custom transition animation 

```Swift
extension YourViewController: UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate {

    func animationController(forPresented presented: UIViewController, presenting: UIViewController, source: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {
        // Your presentation animation hear
    }

    func animationController(forDismissed dismissed: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {
        // Your dismiss animation here
    }
}
```
