**ðŸŒ² Bonsai** makes custom frame size with cool transition animation to any view controller.

## Usage

```Swift
import BonsaiController
```

Add `BonsaiControllerDelegate` extension to your view controller

```Swift
extension YourViewController: BonsaiControllerDelegate {
    
    // return the frame of your Bonsai View Controller
    func frameOfPresentedView(in containerViewFrame: CGRect) -> CGRect {
        
        return CGRect(origin: CGPoint(x: 0, y: containerViewFrame.height / 4), size: CGSize(width: containerViewFrame.width, height: containerViewFrame.height / (4/3)))
    }
    
    // return a Bonsai Controller with SlideIn or Bubble transition animator
    func presentationController(forPresented presented: UIViewController, presenting: UIViewController?, source: UIViewController) -> UIPresentationController? {
    
        // Slide animation from .left, .right, .top, .bottom
        return BonsaiController(fromDirection: .bottom, presentedViewController: presented, delegate: self)
        
        // or Bubble animation initiated from a view
        //return BonsaiController(fromView: yourOriginView, presentedViewController: presented, delegate: self)
        
        // or Bubble animation initiated from a frame
        //return BonsaiController(fromOrigin: yourOriginFrame, presentedViewController: presented, delegate: self)
    }
}
```

## How to Present the view controller 


### From Code:

```Swift
let smallVC = yourViewController()

smallVC.transitioningDelegate = self
smallVC.modalPresentationStyle = .custom

present(smallVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

### From Storyboard:

```Swift
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {

    if segue.destination is YourViewController {
        segue.destination.transitioningDelegate = self
        segue.destination.modalPresentationStyle = .custom
    }
}
```

## Customization


### Disable dismiss on tap outside

```Swift
bonsaiController.springWithDamping = 0.5
bonsaiController.duration = 0.5
bonsaiController.isDisabledTapOutside = true
bonsaiController.isDisabledDismissAnimation = true
public var dismissDirection: Direction? // Availabel only for slide in transition animation
public var isDisabledTapOutside: Bool = false
```

###  Auto dismiss after delay

```Swift
let bonsaiController = BonsaiController(...
bonsaiController.perform(#selector(bonsaiController.dismiss), with: nil, afterDelay: 2)
```

### Custom transition animation

Implement these two method for custom transition animation 

```Swift
extension YourViewController: UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate {

    func animationController(forPresented presented: UIViewController, presenting: UIViewController, source: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {
        // Your presentation animation hear
    }

    func animationController(forDismissed dismissed: UIViewController) -> UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning? {
        // Your dismiss animation here
    }
}
```
